# REST API

A template of REST API app using Oak framework


Start the API server with the command:

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read main.ts
```

which also serves static files from `dist/` which is the vite output.

This starts the server at http://localhost:8000/

Try go to http://localhost:8000/api/Brachiosaurus or http://localhost:8000/api/
